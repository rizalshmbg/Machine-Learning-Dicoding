# PROBLEM B4
#
# Build and train a classifier for the BBC-text dataset.
# This is a multiclass classification problem.
# Do not use lambda layers in your model.
#
# The dataset used in this problem is originally published in: http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html.
#
# Desired accuracy and validation_accuracy > 91%
